      <description>Afternoon,
I thought as an Initial post I would create a post talking about my development gear. From time to time, I always get people asking me why I choose to use my certain laptop, keyboard, etc. and I thought this would be a great time to give a rundown on why I use it, and why I have not upgraded in a long time.

      <description>Afternoon,
Today, I wanted to talk about a future plan I have going on right now. Recently, I had found a Dell R640 for VERY cheap, but my main issue is where the server rack is located, I can not have it running at certain times, as it is very very loud. I am currently in the process of moving this specific server to a place where noise wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be an issue.</description>
