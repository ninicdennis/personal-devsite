    <p>Afternoon,</p>
<p>I thought as an Initial post I would create a post talking about my development gear. From time to time, I always get people asking me why I choose to use my certain laptop, keyboard, etc. and I thought this would be a great time to give a rundown on why I use it, and why I have not upgraded in a long time.</p>
<p>As a tl;dr, here is a simple rundown:</p>
<pre><code>1. Thinkpad T440p - Laptop
2. Logitech MX master 2s - Mouse
3. Happy Hacking Keyboard Pro 2 - Keyboard
4. Campfire Audio Orion - IEM's
5. Fedora 31 - OS
</code></pre>
<h1 id="thinkpad-t440p---laptop">Thinkpad T440p - Laptop</h1>
<p>I would say this is the biggest point of contention in my setup, my lovely Thinkpad T440p! Thinkpads are known for their reliability, duribility, and upgrade potential. This guy back in the day cost over $1000, but I would never pay that price. Luckily, the Thinkpad line has always been a business laptop, 
and with businesses, comes liquidation!</p>
<p>I purchased this laptop for $150, which was an i5 4300m, 16GB of ram, and no HDD. Promply on purchase, I also bought a 512 GB SSD, and an IPS screen, as Thinkpads are known to have terrible screens. One fantastic characteristic about this laptop is upgradability. This was the last model in the line that you could swap out everything including the CPU, so if I need to upgrade, I have my options.</p>
<p>So far, this laptop has been an absolute beast, and I have had no problems running any of my projects, as well as VMs. I&rsquo;d say for the cost, you can&rsquo;t beat it.</p>
<h1 id="logitech-mx-master-2s---mouse">Logitech MX master 2s - Mouse</h1>
<p>The MX master lineup from Logitech is fantastic. I was never a huge fan of bigger wireless mice, because I was a /gamer/ back then, but after I got this mouse, it instantly became my daily driver. Its big, curvy, and has a fantastic scroll wheel! I am usually not a fan of a left/right scroll wheel, but I often find myself using it more and more. All in all, fantastic for the price. I would say the size is what draws people away, but I have giant hands, so it fits super well, compared to all the other mice I have used.</p>
<h1 id="happy-hacking-keyboard-pro-2---keyboard">Happy Hacking Keyboard Pro 2 - Keyboard</h1>
<p>Now, for the people that know me, you know I am a huge advocate of mechanical keyboards. I have built a few for myself, and am absolutely a mechanical keyboard junkie. My first daily driver at home is a Tokyo60v1, a HHKB (Happy Hacking Keyboard) layout with hot swappable switches. I am an absolute fan of this layout, but have never actually owned a HHKB for myself. That is when I noticed a fellow local was selling one for a reasonable price, so I had to pick it up and add it to my collection.</p>
<p>This keyboard is using Topre switches, which are electrocapacitive, not mechanical, but the typing experience is fantastic. It feels like you are popping a bubble every time you type. That and the 60% design makes it very easy to take anywhere I go. I would love to modify it a bit more to make it smoother, but for now, for a workhorse it will do.</p>
<h1 id="campfire-audio-orion---iem">Campfire Audio Orion - IEM</h1>
<p>I also happen to be an audiophile as well! (I know, I am into some expensive hobbies.) I love my audio quality, and it is almost crucial for me to have good sounding IEMs or headphones to be productive, and what other choice than Campfire Audio.</p>
<p>These little guys pack a huge punch, and sound fantastic for the type of music I listen to. Not too bassy, fantastic highs and mids, and just perfect for genres like Jazz and math rock, the two genres I typically listen to. I also bought these from a local, as I refuse to buy anything at a normal price. It was too big of a deal to pass up.</p>
<h1 id="fedora-31---os">Fedora 31 - OS</h1>
<p>For whatever reason, I get a lot of people asking me why I use linux, and for web development, I truly believe that it is the way to go. At work, a majority of the people there run windows, and using applications like docker is a huge hassle to get running. I have spent a couple hours helping others figure out their docker issues because of this, since I am known as the /Linux Guy/, and its crazy the work around you have to do.</p>
<p>As for specifics, I use i3 WM for my desktop environment, which is mostly controlled by keyboard shortcuts. I have been using this WM config made by user alorgill on github, just slightly modified to my needs. If you would like to see my config, you can check my github for it, labeled T440p i3 config. Although I believe it is an outdated version, it still should work fine.</p>
<p>In terms of why I chose Fedora instead of the million other distros available, I have been distro hopping for quite some time, and after using Arch Linux for a long time, I liked the Fedora package manager a bit more, and I like the idea of SELinux. Super secure.</p>
<h1 id="closing">Closing</h1>
<p>Well that is all I use currently as my work rig, and I hope you found it somewhat intresting. Feel free to shoot me a message if you have any questions, I would be happy to help.</p>
