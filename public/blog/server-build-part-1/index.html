    <p>Afternoon,</p>
<p>Today, I wanted to talk about a future plan I have going on right now. Recently, I had found a Dell R640 for VERY cheap, but my main issue is where the server rack is located, I can not have it running at certain times, as it is very very loud. I am currently in the process of moving this specific server to a place where noise wouldn&rsquo;t be an issue. As a solution, I wanted to build a relatively cheap, quiet server for Plex, Audio, Ebook and NAS, as well as mess around with some other self hosted programs.</p>
<h3 id="case---rosewill-rsv-2600">Case - Rosewill RSV-2600</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rosewill-Rackmount-Computer-Pre-Installed-RSV-L4500/dp/B00EW0K8LU/ref=pd_sbs_4?pd_rd_w=ERcli&amp;pf_rd_p=ed1e2146-ecfe-435e-b3b5-d79fa072fd58&amp;pf_rd_r=0EC6V8GJNAV018SP59JS&amp;pd_rd_r=e449c9df-d486-4589-813b-e22f14354627&amp;pd_rd_wg=DbWga&amp;pd_rd_i=B0091IZ1ZG&amp;th=1">Rosewill RSV-2600</a> seemed pretty adequate for the job here. I wanted something relatively small height wise, but still have a decent amount off storage options, and thats when I came across this case. At $99.99, it seemed like a no brainer here. The only downside i&rsquo;ve heard is that the triple fans included can be a bit loud, but I intend to replace these.</p>

<h1 id="motherboard-cpu-and-ram">Motherboard, CPU and RAM</h1>
<p>For this section, I primarily followed <a href="https://forums.serverbuilds.net/t/guide-nas-killer-4-0-fast-quiet-power-efficient-and-flexible-starting-at-125/667/12">this guide</a> on selecting these specific parts. That guide already has an incredible amount of information on what to grab, so I will just briefly go over my choices.</p>
<h3 id="cpu">CPU</h3>
<p>I have decided to go with the Intel Xeon E3-1270V2. A little bit of an older CPU, being released in 2012, but for my application, this should suffice. It has 4 cores, 8 threads, so enough to run enough a few docker containers with no issue.</p>
<h3 id="cpu-cooler">CPU Cooler</h3>
<p>For this, I have chosen the <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/product/fhqbt6/noctua-cpu-cooler-nhl9x65">Noctua NH-L9x65</a> Low profile CPU cooler. I am a huge Noctua fanboy, and my current workstation has 2 of their AF12 fans. For how ugly they truly are, they offer some of the best and most silent performance. I have used the slightly smaller version of this cooler, the NH-L9i, and had no complaints. I believe this should handle the processor at load no problem, and still fit in the case with enough clearance to actually close it. At $50.00, it was a no brainer for me personally.</p>
<h3 id="ram-and-motherboard">RAM and Motherboard</h3>
<p>For the RAM and motherboard, I have chosen a Samsung DDR3 ECC 16 GB kit (Nothing special there), and a Supermicro X9SCM-F mATX motherboard. The motherboard I specifically chose felt it had enough enterprise level features available, as well as enough SATA ports if I would like to populate this entire server. There is probably more I am missing, and thats alright, I&rsquo;ll trust the guide I linked above enough.</p>
<h3 id="power-supply">Power Supply</h3>
<p>For the power supply, I am just going to pick up a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H33SFJU/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;psc=1">500W EVGA Bronze</a> power supply. I&rsquo;ve used them in the past with no issue, and should just work. Nothing really special here.</p>
<h3 id="storage">Storage</h3>
<p>For storage, I am going to be using just some spare drives around. I have a 6TB WD Black I got from a bundle deal on a processor, and a 1TB SSD for boot. Again, nothing special at all.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/parts.PNG" alt="Parts"></p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>As you can see, this is part one of this &ldquo;series&rdquo;. I am waiting for a little bit more funding to actually start this project up, I just wanted to have my parts layed out clear to keep track of this machine. As a conclusion, I will share a few of my self hosted projects I would like to try.</p>
